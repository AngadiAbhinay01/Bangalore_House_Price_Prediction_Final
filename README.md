# Bangalore_House_Price_Prediction_Final

This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
      Predicting Bangalore house prices can be done using various machine learning techniques. Here's an end-to-end explanation of how you can approach the task:

1. Data Collection:
   - Gather data from various sources, such as real estate websites, property listings, or public datasets.
   - The dataset should include relevant features like house size, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, distance to key facilities, and previous sale prices.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features to bring them to a similar range.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features that might improve the model's predictive power, such as the age of the property, the distance to schools, parks, or workplaces, and any other relevant factors.
   - Perform feature selection if needed to remove irrelevant or redundant features that may not contribute to the prediction.

4. Data Splitting:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets. A common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

5. Model Selection:
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression, as this is a regression problem (predicting a continuous value, i.e., the house price).
   - Commonly used algorithms for regression tasks include Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regression.

6. Model Training:
   - Fit the selected model on the training data using the chosen algorithm.
   - The model will learn the patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (house prices) during this process.

7. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - These metrics will give you an idea of how well your model is predicting house prices.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model to achieve better performance.
   - This can be done using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

9. Model Deployment:
   - Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

10. Monitoring and Maintenance:
   - Keep monitoring the model's performance over time to ensure it remains accurate as market conditions change.
   - Retrain the model periodically with new data to keep it up-to-date.
